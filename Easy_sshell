This is an easy to use method for getting an SSH blackhole running. This currently has CentOS 7 instructions. more may follow. 
Again, this is here to make it easy for people.

CENTOS

alias "ll=ls -al"
sudo yum update
sudo yum install gcc
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
#uncomment Port 22 and replace 22 with the desired port
firewall-cmd --add-port=117/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
systemctl restart sshd
#now it is a good idea to relogin with your new port
git clone https://github.com/skeeto/endlessh
cd endlessh
make
sudo mv endlessh /usr/local/bin/
#can use ``which endlessh`` to verify location
sudo cp util/endlessh.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl enable endlessh
mkdir -p /etc/endlessh
sudo nano /etc/endlessh/config
#specify ``Port 22`` yes a capital P. ctrl + O to save and then ctrl + X to exit
sudo systemctl start endlessh
netstat -tulpn | grep endless
#:::22 should be the port
#attempt to login via port 22 and it should just sit there. forever.

passwordless login

useradd -m -s /bin/bash brewst
```passwd brewst```
#set the password for the new user
usermod -aG wheel brewst
mkdir /home/brewst/.ssh
#use puttygen or other tool to generate ssh keys
#you can use winscp or other tool to access the server via sftp if needed.
#remember to use the port you set previously for ssh.
#copy the contents of the public key to /home/brewst/.ssh/authorized_keys
#add ssh-rsa "keyfile contents here wihtout quotes" ensure it is on one line.
#verify you can login with the keypair prior to doing the next step!

sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
#set ``PermitRootLogin yes`` to no. and remember to remove comments.p
#set ``#PasswordAuthentication no``
systemctl restart sshd
